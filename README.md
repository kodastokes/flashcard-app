# Thinkful Flashcard App

## Status
Work in progress - functional but without sytling.

## Background
> A local school has decided to put together a flashcard application, Flashcard-o-matic, to help their students study online. Teachers will use this application to create decks of flashcards for the subjects they teach, and students will study the decks. The school needs you to build the application that the students and teachers will use.

## Focus
- Writing React function components
- Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
- Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()
- Debugging React code

## Requirements
- All tests are passing in Qualified.
- All the props are treated as read-only.
- State is never directly mutated; it's only updated via setState().
- The Edit Card and Create Card screens share the same form component.
- The useEffect() hooks have the appropriate dependencies listed in the dependency array.
- State is "lifted up" to the parent component where appropriate.
- All inputs are controlled.
